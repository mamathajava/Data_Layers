In the context of data and information processing, "raw, trusted, and curated layers" refer to different stages and qualities of data as it progresses through a system or workflow. Here's a breakdown of each layer:

### Raw Layer
- **Definition**: This is the initial stage of data, often directly collected from the source without any processing or validation.
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Unprocessed and unfiltered.
  - Contains all original data, including errors, duplicates, and irrelevant information.
  - May include metadata such as timestamps and source identifiers.
- **Examples**:
  - Sensor readings directly from IoT devices.
  - Clickstream data from websites.
  - Raw transaction logs from databases.

### Trusted Layer
- **Definition**: This layer contains data that has been cleaned, validated, and possibly transformed to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Errors and inconsistencies are corrected.
  - Data is validated against known standards or rules.
  - May involve deduplication and normalization processes.
  - Often includes quality assurance steps.
- **Examples**:
  - A database of customer information that has been cross-checked with other records to ensure correctness.
  - Financial records that have undergone reconciliation and validation.

### Curated Layer
- **Definition**: This is the most refined layer, where data is not only trusted but also organized and tailored for specific use cases, often with added context and insights.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Highly processed and enriched with additional information.
  - Structured and organized to meet the needs of specific business processes or analytical tasks.
  - May include aggregated, summarized, or derived data points.
  - Often involves human intervention to add insights, classifications, or categorizations.
- **Examples**:
  - Business intelligence reports and dashboards.
  - Datasets prepared for machine learning models.
  - Curated content collections in a digital library.

### Usage in a Workflow
1. **Ingestion**: Data is collected and enters the raw layer.
2. **Processing and Cleaning**: Data is validated, cleaned, and transformed, moving it into the trusted layer.
3. **Enrichment and Curation**: Data is further processed, enriched, and organized for specific purposes, resulting in the curated layer.

Each layer serves a distinct purpose, ensuring that data is handled appropriately at each stage to meet quality and usability standards. The goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights by progressively enhancing its reliability and relevance.
